reglesText = Rule 1: Only two players can compete.\n\
  Rule 2: We distribute forty-eight seeds in the twelve holes at the rate of four seeds per hole.\n\
  Rule 3: Each player takes turns, the one who plays first is drawn at random. The player will take all the seeds from one of the holes in their territory and distribute them, one per hole, counterclockwise.\n\
  Rule 4: If his last seed falls into a hole in the opponent's camp and there are now two or three seeds in that hole, the player collects these two or three seeds and sets them aside. Then he looks at the previous square: if it is in the opposing camp and contains two or three seeds, he collects these seeds, and so on until he arrives at his camp or until there is have a number of seeds other than two or three.\n\
  Rule 5: We do not skip a cell when shelling except when we have twelve seeds or more, that is to say we make a complete turn: we do not fill the cell in which we have just taken seeds.\n\
  Rule 6: It is necessary to "feed" the adversary, that is to say that, when this one does not have any more seeds, it is absolutely necessary to play a move which allows him to replay then. If this is not possible, the game ends and the player who was going to play captures the remaining seeds.\n\
  Rule 7: If a move were to take all the opponent's seeds, then the move can be made, but no capture is made: you must not "starve" the opponent.\n\
  Rule 8: The game ends when: ➢ One of the players has captured at least 25 seeds, and is designated the winner (medium mode) ➢ Or there are only 6 seeds left in play and one of the players have no more seeds in their camp and that their opponent has not had the opportunity to give them back (beginner mode)\n\
  Rule 9: When there are no more than 10 seeds left on the board, the player with the hand may propose to abandon the game. If accepted, the two players share the remaining seeds. If the total seeds on the board are less than 6, without any of the players having a total of seeds greater than 24. The game is drawn.
